# PasswordVault

The inspiration for this app is to help people who forget their passwords frequently. With this app, they will only have to remember one password, which is the one they would use to open their user account within the app. 

Once logged in, PasswordVault would display all of their passwords along with their respective usernames and passwords, and the websites in which they are used for.
